## Syllabus

### Catalog Description

A study of the design and implementation of intelligent computer systems that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In addition to examining techniques for designing intelligent software agents, students investigate the social, political, and ethical implications of intelligent systems. Through hands-on activities that often require team-work, students explore the application of artificial intelligence methods in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and video game development. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. 

Prerequisite: CMPSC 101 or CMPSC 102. 

Distribution Requirements: QR (Quantitative Reasoning), SP (Scientific Process).

### Course Learning Outcomes

Students who earn a C or better in this course will achieve the following objectives:

1. Correctly implement an intelligent agent and accurately describe its properties.
2. Correctly apply search algorithms to solve an agent-based problem.
3. Design, implement, and assess an intelligent system for various artificial intelligence applications.
4. Correctly explain and justify how a problem could be solved through the use of supervised, unsupervised, and/or reinforcement machine learning algorithms.
5. Evaluate intelligent systems while considering their social, political, and ethical implications and communicate their outcomes in both written and oral forms.

## Required materials

### Laptop

A department-approved laptop, with an adequate charge, is required in every class session.

The laptop requirements are avaialable [here](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/#:~:text=Department%20Approved%20Laptops&text=In%20order%20to%20successfully%20complete,10%20or%2011%2064%2Dbit). If you don't have a laptop that meets these specifications, you can request to borrow one using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds-N61LLpYpZZBunlR_JigGH9eOBxvZfpEV71o73DyhTDQvw/viewform). The department has a limited number of loaner laptops available, so the earlier you request, the better!

### Textbook(s)

There are no physical textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed in class. There are a few primary resources we will use to support course materials:

- [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/weeks/) (Brian Yu, David J. Malan) is the living textbook for this course, complete with videos, transcripts, and notes. 
- [A People's Guide to AI](https://alliedmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/peoples-guide-ai.pdf) (Mini Onuoha, Mother Cyborg) will help us contextualize Artificial Intelligence in the broader social structures of our our world.
- [Hard Fork](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork) (Kevin Roose, Casey Newton) is a podcast that provides a critical look at the state of the art each week.

### Platforms

This course relies on GitHub and Discord. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.



## Assignments & Evaluation

### Specifications Grading

This course uses a version **specifications grading**. This means that instead of receiving points for different assignments and a weighted average, each assignment receives a grade of either **satisfactory** or **unsatisfcatory**.  You will also earn **engagement points** for attending and engaging in class, and these points can either increase or lower your grade. 

Each assignment is bundled into a certain category. To achieve a certain letter grade, you must receive satisfactory marks on the required number of assignments for that grade.

You can miss a limited amount of assignments under this policy, and **tokens** will also allow for a few late or resubmitted assignments. See below for detailed information on how assignment completion leads to different grades. 

### Challenges & Projects

Major assignments include ten challenges and three projects, including the final project. 

#### Challenges

Challenges are coding assignments where you use AI concepts to solve directed problems with code. As the name suggests, challenges are meant to be challenging. You will be assigned ten challenges throughout the semester. 

Satisfactory completion of challenges requires you to receive a certain number of gator checks. You will also need to verbally answer questions about each challenge during lab time, without referencing the assignment. 

#### Projects

Projects are open-ended assignments where you create your own research prompt and respond to it using a specific AI concept. These projects include:

- Project 1: Search
- Project 2: Uncertainty & Prediction
- Project 3: Machine Learning

#### Grading Scheme

These grading criteria are subject to change, but changes should never reduce your chances of a higher grade. 

| Grade | Challenges                              | Projects                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A     | Satisfactory grade on 8 / 10 challenges | Satisfactory grade on all three projects                     |
| B     | Satisfactory grade on 7 /10 challenges  | Satisfactory grade on two projects. Attempt all three projects. |
| C     | Satisfactory grade on 6 /10 challenges  | Satisfactory grade on two projects.                          |
| D     | Satisfactory grade on 5 /10 challenges  | Satisfactory grade on one project. Attempt at least two projects. |

If you receive checkmarks for different grade levels in different columns, an average of the two will be taken. This may lead to a +/- added to your grade. 

### Engagement Points

You can receive engagement points by:

- Attending class and completing entrace/exit tickets. 
  - Tickets will be assigned during class, and cannot be completed outside of class time. They are the primary form of attendance tracking, which will be supplemented by visual confirmation that student is present.
  - Tickets come in different forms, such as Google Forms, Discord threads, and short Github assignments. You receive points for completing these assignments regardless of correctness, but you must at least attempt to respond to the prompt to ensure credit. 
  - Successful completion of some tickets will require outside-of-class preparation, such as reading an article or listening to a podcast. 
- Speaking in class (answering a question, asking a question, conributing to a discussion, responding to a prompt etc.) 
- Speaking with professor one-on-one during lab time or open work time
- Attending professor office hours
- Presenting a project (earns 5 points)

You have opportunities to earn at least ten points during each full week of class (six entrance + exit tickets, three chances for in-class participation, one or more chance for office hours). Your engagement points affect your grade as follows:

| Average Weekly Points | Grade Impact                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| >=7                   | Adds half a letter grade, if possible      |
| 6                     | No impact                                  |
| 5                     | Subtracts half a letter grade, if possible |
| <=4                   | Subtracts a full letter grade              |

Weekly averages will be rounded to the nearest whole number

This system means that you can miss roughly two weeks of class without consequence, assuming you are participating in class each week. Note that this accomodation is meant to cover emergencies, and additional absences may not be excused. 

**As an exception: if you are sick with something contagious, you should not come to class even if you have already missed the permitted two weeks. If this is your situation, please contact your professor. In most situations, the ~two week allowance already in place will allow you to stay home when sick without consequence or having to contact professor. ** 

See department policies for more information on attendance. 

### Tokens and Late Assignments

**Late challenges and projects will not be accepted unless a token is applied at least 24 hours before the assignment deadline, with limited exceptions for emergencies.** Depending on your grade goals, you can also miss some assignments without penalty based on the spec grading schema. 

**These tokens are no-questions-asked.** They are meant to accomodate emergency situations, so there is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token. 

You will have two tokens, and each either

- Extends **one** assignment's deadline by one week

  OR

- Allows resubmit of **one** assignment one week after receiving your grade. Resubmits can only be used on assignments where an on-time attempt was made

Each token works on limited assignments: 

- Token 1: can be used on project 1 or challenges 1-5
- Token 2: can be used on project 2 or challenges 6-10

The third and final project must be turned in on time. Tokens cannot be applied. 

See department policies for more information on tokens. 

## Course Policies

See department policies for more information on the below. 

### Illness and Wellness, Mental and Physical

**If you think you may be sick, stay home** —- particularly if your symptoms suggest a contagious illness (i.e. cough, fever, sneezing, sore throat). For more information about missed class and sickness, see CIS department policies. 

#### Mental Health

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

If you are dealing with something contagious or that requires accomodations I can provide, let me know. In addition, you should communicate me if life circumstances are preventing you from fully engaging with the course. Otherwise, I don't require details, and the above policies are meant to create space fo the inevitable disruptions of daily life. Processing certain details may lie beyond my professional expertise, and I want to do my best to serve you in my capacity as your professor. If emergencies disruptions interfere with your course work to an extent that the above policies are insufficient, please make an office hours appointment. In these cases, requeseting a late drop (X) or incomplete (I) in the course may be the most appropriate option. 

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC’s website (sites.allegheny.edu/counseling). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny’s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out.

### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor’s assistance can schedule an appointment through their Office Hour Calendar near the top of this page.

### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the *Compass* .

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Artificial Intelligence in Class

It is recommended that you limit use of AI-assisted code, as writing the code yourself faciliates better learning. You will need to demonstrate understanding of core concepts taught in class through verbal and written work, beyond just writing the code. 

I request that you include any prompts you used to generate code inline with the comment `#AI PROMPT` followed by the name of the tool (e.g. Copilot, GPT). See department policies for information on using AI assistance on class assignments. 

### Religious Observance

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/) for more details.

### Educational Accommodations

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898. Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/) for more details.
